Sapher Overlay

This overlay contains ebuilds for miscellaneous software I created.

Contributing to this overlay by adding new ebuilds wouldn't make any sense since
this is *my* overlay. :P However feel free to submit bug fixes / improvements.

me a pull request.

If you are using ebuilds in this overlay as part of Funtoo Linux (because they are
merged into the main Funtoo Linux Portage tree, for example,) then
please also open an issue at `bugs.funtoo.org`_.
